# web-homework

For this activity I will be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I'vecreated in a past assignment. 
Specifically, I will be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. 
These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.
